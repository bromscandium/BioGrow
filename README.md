# Welcome to Our Beautiful Team: Valli 🚜🌾

## Purposeful Hacking
Before eating, some indians might say Annadata sukhi bhava: “Those who are providing me with this food, let them be happy'. But in India, the situation is currently not that simple for farmers. 

Valli, our solution, aims to put the farmers at the center, and empower them to make better decisions. No need to understand what technology to use: just grab your phone and start talking. Insights, Community, and even Loans will be presented to you in an educational, nudging way. 

Because if they're happy, we all are. So we invite you to join us tackling the food crisis in the long-run, one farmer at a time. 

We're passionate about this because our teammate's father has been dedicating his entire life to agriculture for that same purpose, and inspired the now 27 year old hacker to seek a meaningful life with purpose, by going where people need us to be: for him? 

That’s what led us to these 36h: the culmination of our tribute to the world’s Aannadata's, from India, to Ukraine.

Welcome to Valli! Our solution enables you to unlock insights from your data in the world of farming and agriculture effortlessly.
